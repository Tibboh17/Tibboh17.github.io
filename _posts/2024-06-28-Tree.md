# Tree
- A hierarchical data structure in which a collection of elements known as nodes are connected to each other via edges.

# Concepts of Tree

### Root Node
- The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node.

### Leaf Node
- The nodes which do not have any child nodes.

### Parent Node
- The node which is a predecessor of a node.

### Child Node
- The node which is the immediate successor of a node.

### Ancestor
- Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node.

### Descendant
- Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node.

### Subtree
- Any node of the tree along with its descendant.

# Types of Tree with the Number of Children

### Binary Tree
- Each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it.

### Tenary Tree
- Each node has at most three child nodes.

### N-ary Tree (Generic Tree)
- Each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children.
 
# Types of Tree with the Nodes' Values

### Binary Search Tree
- Shares similarities with a binary tree.
- The value of the left child in a binary search tree is always smaller than that of the parent node, and the value of the right child is larger than that of the parent node.

### AVL Tree
- A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains the height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node to be at most 1.
