# Linked List
- Consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
- Allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

# Concepts of Linked List

### Node
- A basic building block of a linked list.
- Contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

### Head
- The first node in the linked list.
- Serves as the starting point for traversing the list.

### Tail
- The last node in the linked list.
- The tail's next reference points to null, indicating the end of the list.
 
# Types of Linked List

### Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- Traversal can only be done in one direction (from head to tail).

### Doubly Linked List
- Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence.
- Allows for bidirectional traversal.
