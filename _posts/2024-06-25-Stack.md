# Stack
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows a specific order for operations.
- LIFO (Last In, First Out): The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

# Types of Stack

#### Fixed Size Stack
- A fixed size stack has a pre-defined capacity and cannot grow or shrink dynamically.
- Typically implemented using arrays.
- Efficient in terms of access time, but limited by its fixed size which may lead to overflow.

#### Dynamic Size Stack
- A dynamic size stack can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.
- Usually implemented using a linked list or dynamic arrays (like Python lists).
- More flexible as it can adjust its size, but might incur overhead for dynamic resizing.

# Operations of Stack

#### Push
- Add an element to the top of the stack, increasing its size by one.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Pop
- Remove the element from the top of the stack, decreasing its size by one, and return the removed element.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Peek (or Top)
- Retrieve the top element of the stack without removing it, allowing a look at the value without modifying the stack.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### isFull
- Check if the stack is full (only applicable for fixed size stacks).
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### isEmpty
- Check if the stack is empty.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Size
- Return the number of elements currently in the stack.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)
