# Heap
- The tree which is a complete binary tree.
- Efficiently supports priority queue operations, such as finding and removing the maximum or minimum element.

# Concepts of Heap
#### Node
- A basic building block of a heap.
- Contains data and references (links) ro its child nodes.

#### Root
- The topmost node in the heap
- Serves as the starting point for traversing the heap.
- In a max heap, the root is the maximum element: in a min heap, the root is the minimum element.

#### Leaf
- A node with no child nodes.
- The leaves are the nodes at the bottom level of the heap.

# Types of Heap
#### Max Heap
- The value of the root node is the greatest among all its child nodes.
- Every value of the parent node is equal to or greater than the value of its child node.
- Useful for algorithms that need to repeatedly access the maximum element.

#### Min Heap
- The value of the root node is the smallest among all its child nodes.
- Every value of the parent node is equal to or less than the value of its child node.
- Useful for algorithms that need to repeatedly access the minimum element.
