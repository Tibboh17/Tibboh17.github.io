# Sorting Algorithm
- An algorithm that puts elements of a list into a specific order based on a comparison operator.

# Stability

#### Stable Sort
- Maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys.
- Examples: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort.

#### Unstable Sort
- Does not maintain the relative order of items with equal sort keys.
- Examples: Selection Sort, Quick Sort.

# In-Place

#### In-Place Algorithm
- Sorts the input array in place, without using additional memory (strict definition).
- May use a small amount of extra space (broad definition).
- Examples: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort (by broad definition).

#### Not In-Place Algorithm
- Requires additional memory for sorting.
- Examples: Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
