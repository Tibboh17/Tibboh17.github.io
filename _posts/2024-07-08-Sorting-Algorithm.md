# Sorting Algorithm
- An algorithm that puts elements of a list into a specific order based on a comparison operator.

# Stability

#### Stable Sort
- Maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys.
- Examples: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort.

#### Unstable Sort
- Does not maintain the relative order of items with equal sort keys.
- Examples: Selection Sort, Quick Sort.

# In-Place
#### In-Place Algorithm
- Sorts the input array in place, without using additional memory (strict definition).
- May use a small amount of extra space (broad definition).
- Examples: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort (by broad definition).

#### Not In-Place Algorithm
- Requires additional memory for sorting.
- Examples: Merge Sort, Heap Sort.

# Applications of Sorting Algorithm
#### Searching
- Sorting helps in efficiently searching elements using algorithms like binary search.

#### Data Organization
- Helps in arranging data for better readability and organization.

#### Algorithms
- Many algorithms like graph algorithms rely on sorting as a subroutine.

#### Databases
- Sorting is crucial for query optimization and efficient data retrieval.

#### Machine Learning
- Data preprocessing often involves sorting to organize and analyze data.
