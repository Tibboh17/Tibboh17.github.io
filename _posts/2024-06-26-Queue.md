# Queue
- A queue is a linear data structure that follows a specific order for operations.
- FIFO (First In, First Out): The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

# Types of Queue

#### Simple Queue
- A simple queue has a fixed size and elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- Typically implemented using arrays.

#### Circular Queue
- A circular queue is a queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
- This allows efficient use of memory by reusing empty spaces created by dequeuing elements.

#### Priority Queue
- A priority queue is a type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority.
- Elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their order in the queue.

#### Double-ended Queue (Deque)
- A double-ended queue allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the rear.

# Operations of Queue

#### Enqueue
- Add an element to the rear of the queue, increasing its size by one.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Dequeue
- Remove the element from the front of the queue, decreasing its size by one, and return the removed element.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Front (or Peek)
- Retrieve the front element of the queue without removing it, allowing a look at the value without modifying the queue.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### isFull
- Check if the queue is full (only applicable for fixed size queues).
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### isEmpty
- Check if the queue is empty.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)

#### Size
- Return the number of elements currently in the queue.
- **Time complexity:** O(1)
